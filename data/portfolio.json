I love merging software and hardware to create interactive experiences that people can genuinely enjoy. My interests span automation, cybersecurity, data science, and web developmentâ€”if itâ€™s tech, Iâ€™m all in. \n When Iâ€™m not tinkering with gadgets or code, youâ€™ll find me behind a camera, capturing moments as they happen. Iâ€™m also into carsâ€”whether itâ€™s exploring the latest automotive tech or just hitting the road, I enjoy the thrill of seeing machines in action. For me, itâ€™s all about making stuff work and enjoying the results, whether itâ€™s in a project, a photo, or under the hood.",
